item ids with duplicated inventories :
SELECT DISTINCT i1.id, i1.item_id, i1.is_present, i1.is_usable, i1.comment FROM inventory AS i1 FULL JOIN inventory AS i2 ON i1.item_id = i2.item_id WHERE i1.id != i2.id AND i1.date = i2.date ORDER BY i1.item_id, i1.id;

delete duplicated inventories:
DELETE FROM inventory WHERE id IN (3, 7,   18,   20,   24,   32,  192,   76,   79,  218,  137, 138, 167,  177);

last inventories for each item:
SELECT item_id, date FROM inventory AS i1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT date FROM inventory AS i2 WHERE i1.item_id = i2.item_id AND i2.date > i1.date) ORDER BY item_id;

set usage counters
UPDATE borrow SET usage_counter = 2 WHERE to_datetime IS NOT null AND usage_counter = 0
